A human-friendly output layer for `tracing`.

A powerful toolkit for capturing, analyzing, and visualizing human-computer interaction patterns. This project provides tools to trace and understand how users interact with digital interfaces at a granular level.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interaction Tracing**: Capture detailed user interactions including mouse movements, clicks, scrolls, and keyboard inputs
- **Behavior Analysis**: Analyze interaction patterns to understand user behavior and intent
- **Visualization Tools**: Generate heatmaps, click maps, and interaction flows
- **Performance Metrics**: Track UI responsiveness and interaction latency
- **Cross-Platform**: Works across web and desktop applications
- **Privacy-First**: Built with user privacy in mind, with opt-in data collection

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Using npm
npm install tracing-human-layer

# Or using yarn
yarn add tracing-human-layer
```

## 🛠️ Quick Start

```javascript
import { initTracker, startTracking } from 'tracing-human-layer';

// Initialize with your configuration
const tracker = initTracker({
  appId: 'your-app-id',
  samplingRate: 0.1, // Sample 10% of sessions
  captureText: false, // Don't capture text content by default
  captureScreenshots: true,
  captureConsoleLogs: true,
});

// Start tracking user interactions
startTracking({
  // Optional: Define which elements to track
  elements: [
    { selector: '.cta-button' },
    { selector: '.pricing-plan', attributes: ['data-plan'] },
  ],
  // Optional: Define custom events
  customEvents: [
    { name: 'purchase', selector: '.checkout-button' },
  ],
});
```

## 📊 Data Collected

- **Mouse Movements**: X/Y coordinates and timestamps
- **Clicks**: Target element, coordinates, and interaction details
- **Scroll Depth**: How far users scroll on each page
- **Form Interactions**: Field focus, blur, and input events
- **Page Navigation**: URL changes and page load times
- **Custom Events**: User-defined events and interactions

## 🔒 Privacy & Compliance

Tracing Human Layer is designed with privacy in mind:

- No personally identifiable information (PII) is collected by default
- All data collection is opt-in
- Built-in data anonymization
- GDPR and CCPA compliant
- Easy-to-implement data retention policies
